# Bank-Marketing

## Bank-Marketing Dataset Analysis Project

### Overview
This project involves analyzing a bank dataset to derive meaningful insights and answer various business-related questions. The dataset includes information about customers' financial behavior, and past interactions with the bank. The goal is to explore the data, perform statistical analysis, and improve decision-making processes.

### Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `age`: Age of the customer
- `job`: Job type of the customer
- `marital`: Marital status of the customer
- `education`: Education level of the customer
- `default`: Whether the customer has credit in default
- `balance`: Average yearly balance in euros
- `housing`: Whether the customer has a housing loan
- `loan`: Whether the customer has a personal loan
- `contact`: Contact communication type
- `day`: Last contact day of the month
- `month`: Last contact month of the year
- `duration`: Last contact duration in seconds
- `campaign`: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
- `pdays`: Number of days since the customer was last contacted from a previous campaign
- `previous`: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
- `poutcome`: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
- `deposit`: Whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit

### Objectives
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on their financial behavior.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to predict customer behavior, such as the likelihood of making a deposit.
